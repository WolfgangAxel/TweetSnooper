# TweetSnooper
A reddit/twitter bot that copies tweets to a subreddit's sidebar. The name comes from tweets and snoos (I am not a clever man).

# Usage
Launch the script with Python 3.5 or greater. The first launch will walk you through creating the config file, then it will use that data until the file gets deleted.

*Should* work on all platforms with the requirements installed.

# Requirements
